# Graphene triclinic primitive Unit Cell
# Triclinic simulation box
#  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The parallelepiped (of the simulation box) has its "origin" at (xlo,ylo,zlo) and is defined by 3 edge vectors
# starting from the origin given by a = (xhi-xlo,0,0); b = (xy,yhi-ylo,0); c = (xz,yz,zhi-zlo).
# xy,xz,yz can be 0.0 or positive or negative values and are called "tilt factors" because they are the
# amount of displacement applied to faces of an originally orthogonal box to transform it into the parallelepiped.
# Note that in LAMMPS the triclinic simulation box edge vectors a, b, and c cannot be arbitrary vectors.
# As indicated, a must be aligned with the x axis, b must be in the xy plane, and c is arbitrary.
